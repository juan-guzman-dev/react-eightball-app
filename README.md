# Magic Eight Ball App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A simulation of a classic kid’s toy, the [Magic Eight Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball).
 

When you click on the ball, it chooses a random answer & the matching color for that answer.
